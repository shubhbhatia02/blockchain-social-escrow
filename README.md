# blockchain-social-escrow

A decentralized, trustless escrow service for collaborations between project founders and Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) or influencers. This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure that agreements are honored and payments are released automatically upon the fulfillment of predefined conditions.

## The Problem

Collaborations between founders and KOLs often rely on trust. Founders risk paying for services that aren't delivered as promised, while KOLs risk not being compensated for their work. Traditional escrow services can be slow, expensive, and subject to centralization risks.

## The Solution

This project provides a smart contract-based escrow system that locks the founder's funds until the KOL meets the agreed-upon deliverables (e.g., social media posts, content creation with specific engagement metrics). The entire process is transparent, automated, and enforced by code, eliminating the need for a trusted intermediary.
